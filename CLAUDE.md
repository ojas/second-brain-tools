# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A Rust CLI tool for managing a "second brain" file system. The tool parses JSON tree structures (generated by the `tree` command) and outputs formatted file listings with paths, sizes, and timestamps.

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
cargo test
```

### Building
```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# The binary will be at:
target/debug/second-brain-tools
```

### Running the Tool
```bash
# Generate example tree data
tree -J --du -D --timefmt "%Y-%m-%d" . > tree_example.json

# Run with example data
cargo run tree_example.json

# Run the built binary
target/debug/second-brain-tools ~/sync/trees/tree_sync.json > ~/sync/trees/tree_sync.txt
```

## Code Architecture

### Input Format
The tool expects JSON input from the `tree` command with the `-J --du -D --timefmt "%Y-%m-%d"` flags. The JSON structure has:
- First element: Root `TreeNode` with recursive directory structure
- Second element: `ReportNode` with summary statistics (total size, file/directory counts)

### Key Data Structures (src/main.rs)

- `TreeNode`: Recursive structure representing files/directories with `node_type`, `name`, `size`, `time`, and optional `contents` array
- `ReportNode`: Summary statistics with `size`, `directories`, and `files` counts
- `TreeList`: Top-level wrapper containing one `TreeNode` and one `ReportNode`

Note: `TreeNode.node_type` uses `#[serde(rename = "type")]` because "type" is a Rust keyword.

### Core Functions

- `read_tree_from_file()`: Deserializes JSON file into `TreeList` struct
- `walk_tree()`: Recursively prints tree structure with indentation
- `walk_tree_fullpath()`: Recursively prints full paths with size and timestamp in tab-separated format
- `serde_json_dump()`: Main entry point that parses CLI args, loads tree, and outputs formatted listing

### Output Format
Current output is tab-separated: `full_path\tsize\ttime`

## Dependencies

- `serde` (with derive feature): For data structure serialization/deserialization
- `serde_json`: For JSON parsing

## Security Note

The `.crates_io_token` file contains a crates.io API token and is tracked in `.gitignore`. Do not commit this file.
