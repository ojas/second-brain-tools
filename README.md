# Ojas's Second Brain Tools

Learning Rust. Building a CLI tool to help me manage my second brain.

```bash

cargo test
cargo run
cargo build

target/debug/second-brain-tools ~/sync/trees/tree_sync.json > ~/sync/trees/tree_sync.txt
```

Note: crate.io token stored locally in .crate_io_token, take care.
